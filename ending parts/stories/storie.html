          <h2>2012 - The Beginning</h2>
          <p>
            It all started in 2012, when Alex set out with nothing but a
            backpack and a deep desire to explore. He had no grand plan, just a
            belief that the world was meant to be experienced beyond textbooks
            and pictures. His first trips were simple — hiking local trails,
            taking bus rides across cities, and meeting people from different
            walks of life. What began as a personal adventure slowly became a
            calling.

          <h2>2015 - Expanding Horizons</h2>
          <p>
            By 2015, word had spread. Friends and families started asking Alex
            to plan their vacations. That’s when
            <strong>Alex Travel</strong> was officially born. We expanded from
            local tours to international adventures — flights to Asia, desert
            safaris in Dubai, cultural tours across Europe. Each journey was
            carefully crafted with love and attention, ensuring travelers didn’t
            just “see places” but truly <em>experienced</em> them.

          <h2>2018 - Building Our Values</h2>
          <p>
            By 2018, Alex Travel had grown into a small but passionate team. We
            believed in values that set us apart: authenticity, sustainability,
            and meaningful connections. We partnered with local communities,
            supported eco-friendly tours, and created cultural experiences that
            allowed travelers to dance in local festivals, taste traditional
            meals, and hear stories from elders. Our mission wasn’t just tourism
            — it was <strong>human connection</strong>.

          <h2>2020 - Resilience Through Challenges</h2>
          <p>
            When the world paused in 2020, so did travel. But our spirit didn’t
            die. We focused on helping people rediscover the beauty of local
            adventures — hidden beaches, quiet mountain trails, and city tours
            in their own backyard. It was during this time that we built an even
            stronger bond with our travelers, reminding them that adventure
            doesn’t always require a plane ticket. Sometimes, it’s right at your
            door.
