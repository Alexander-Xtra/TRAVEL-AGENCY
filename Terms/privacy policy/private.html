        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          At Alex Travel, we respect your privacy and are committed to
          protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how
          we collect, use, store, and protect your data when you use our
          website, mobile application, or services. By using our platform, you
          agree to the terms outlined in this policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          We may collect personal information such as your name, email address,
          phone number, billing details, and preferences when you interact with
          our services. Additionally, we may collect non-personal data such as
          browser type, IP address, and cookies to improve your experience.
        </p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          Your information is used to process bookings, manage your account,
          provide customer support, personalize your experience, and send
          important notifications. We may also use anonymized data for research,
          analytics, and service improvements.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
          We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal data to third parties.
          However, we may share limited information with trusted service
          providers (such as payment processors) who assist in delivering our
          services, under strict confidentiality agreements.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
          You have the right to access, update, or request deletion of your
          personal information. You may also opt out of receiving promotional
          emails at any time by following the unsubscribe link provided.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          We implement appropriate security measures to safeguard your data
          against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
          However, no online system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee
          absolute protection.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will
          be posted on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you
          to review this policy regularly.
