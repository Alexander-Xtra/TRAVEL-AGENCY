      <h2>Eligibility for Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        We strive to ensure customer satisfaction with every booking. Refunds may be requested 
        under the following conditions: cancellations made within 48 hours of booking, duplicate 
        transactions, or services not delivered as promised.
      </p>

      <h2>Non-Refundable Circumstances</h2>
      <p>
        Refunds are not available for cancellations made after the service has commenced, 
        no-shows, or where terms of the booking clearly state "non-refundable." 
        Any fees charged by third-party providers are also non-refundable.
      </p>

      <h2>Refund Process</h2>
      <p>
        To request a refund, please contact our support team with your booking details. 
        Refunds, if approved, will be issued to your original payment method within 7â€“14 
        business days, depending on your bank or payment provider.
      </p>

      <h2>Partial Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        In certain cases, we may issue partial refunds (e.g., when part of a service has been 
        used but not completed). The eligibility for partial refunds will be evaluated on 
        a case-by-case basis.
      </p>

      <h2>Amendments</h2>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to update or modify this Refund Policy at any time. Changes will 
        be effective immediately upon posting on this page.
