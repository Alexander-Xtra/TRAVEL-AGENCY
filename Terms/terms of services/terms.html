        <h2>Welcome to Alex Travel</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms & Services govern your use of the Alex Travel website,
          booking services, and related offerings. Please read them carefully —
          they explain your rights, responsibilities, and what you can expect
          from us as your travel partner.

        <h2>1. Agreement and Acceptance</h2>
        <p>
          By browsing our website, contacting support, or completing a booking,
          you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use our
          services. We reserve the right to update these Terms; material changes
          will be posted and dated.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Bookings & Confirmations</h2>
        <p>
          When you confirm a booking, we will send a booking confirmation to
          your email. A confirmed booking means suppliers (airlines, hotels,
          tour operators) have accepted the reservation. Keep your booking
          reference — it is essential for changes and support.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Accuracy:</strong> You must provide accurate passenger and
            contact details.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Names & IDs:</strong> Ensure traveler names match
            passports/IDs used for travel.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Special requests:</strong> Requests (dietary, accessibility)
            are forwarded to suppliers but not guaranteed.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. Pricing & Payment</h2>
        <p>
          Prices shown on the site are the most current available at the time of
          display. Prices may change before booking confirmation. Payment is
          processed through secure third-party gateways. We do not store raw
          card numbers.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Currency:</strong> Prices are displayed in the currency
            indicated; conversion rates may apply.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Final payment:</strong> Some bookings require deposit and
            balance payments. Check your confirmation for payment schedule.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Changes, Cancellations & No-shows</h2>
        <p>
          Changes or cancellations may be subject to supplier rules and fees. We
          will always try to minimize fees but we cannot control supplier
          policies. If you miss a flight or service (no-show), refunds are
          unlikely — check suppliers’ terms carefully.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you request changes, we will attempt to apply them, and you’ll be
          notified of any extra costs. In events like airline schedule changes,
          we will contact you with alternatives where possible.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Liability & Insurance</h2>
        <p>
          Alex Travel acts as an intermediary and arranges services through
          third-party suppliers. While we vet our partners, we are not liable
          for events outside our direct control (weather, supplier insolvency,
          strikes). We strongly recommend travel insurance to protect against
          unexpected events.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Customer Conduct</h2>
        <p>
          When using Alex Travel services, you agree to behave respectfully.
          Suppliers may refuse service to travelers who endanger others or break
          local laws. You are responsible for your actions, documents, and
          compliance with entry/visa requirements.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2>7. Complaints & Support</h2>

      <section>
        <h2>8. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where Alex
          Travel operates. If disputes arise, please contact us so we can
          attempt amicable resolution before legal action.
